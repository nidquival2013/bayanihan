		<h1>BAYANIHAN</h1>
		<h2>It's Our Turn to Give</h2>
	</head>

	<body>
		<p>Each year, the Philippines is struck with floods, typhoons, earthquakes, among others.
			<br/>Homes are shattered...
			<br/>Memories are swept...
			<br/>Countless lives are lost.
		</p>
		<p>We believe that the term Bayanihan, or performing communal work, is still alive. As such, this is our time to give back to the community, to our less fortunate individuals and families, and make a lasting impact on their lives.
